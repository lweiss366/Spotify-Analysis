# Analyzing Spotify Dataset
## by: Luke Weiss

## This data analysis uses spotify song data starting from the year 1921 and going to the present. The goal of this analysis was to do a full investigation of the dataset, starting with pre processing and cleaning of the data, doing some visualizations, and then from there going into mutliple machine learning algorithms. My end goal of the models were to predict how popular a given song would be based on certain stats about it. In this project, I go through linear and logistic regression models, decision trees, and KMeans clustering.
